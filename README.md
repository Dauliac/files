In-repository file generation flake-parts module

As Nix users, we naturally want

1. the source of all truth to reside within Nix files ðŸ“œ

2. all other files to be generated âš¡

but

1. project repositories are expected to include tracked readmes ðŸ“„

2. Git tracked or not, `.gitignore` files must sometimes exist ðŸ¤·

3. `.github/workflows/*` must be Git tracked (don't get me started on these)

4. and the list goes on

And you'd be right!
..except that checking that your repository is clean cannot be a flake check.

> Okay, so I make a flake check for each generated file

Well, yes, you could.
..or you could use this projectâ€”if you're using flake-parts, that is (sorry).
