In-repository file generation flake-parts module

As Nix users, we naturally want
the source of all truth to reside within Nix files ðŸ“œ
and other files that include that truth to be generated âš¡.

For example, who didn't want to
dynamically include various facts about their project
in the readme and make sure those are up-to-date?

but

1. project repositories are expected to include _tracked_ readmes ðŸ“„

2. Git tracked or not, `.gitignore` files must sometimes exist ðŸ¤·

3. `.github/workflows/*` must be Git tracked (don't get me started on these)

4. and the list goes on

You may be thinking

And you'd be right!
...except that checking that your repository is clean cannot be a flake check.

> Okay, so I'll make a flake check for each generated file.

Well, yes, you could.
...or you could use this projectâ€”if you're using flake-parts, that is (sorry).
